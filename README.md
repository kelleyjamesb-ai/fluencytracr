# LearnAIR_Engable_Tool
This is a way to capture organizational signals on AI Fluency using passive data.

## Scope guardrails
This project intentionally rejects surveillance and scope creep. Please read and follow
the guardrails in [SCOPE_GUARDRAILS.md](SCOPE_GUARDRAILS.md) before proposing changes.

## FluencyTracr V1 Confidence & Signal Layer
The confidence layer enforces inference safety invariants for behavioral signals:
- Outputs are signals, not facts, and are strictly binary: `SURFACE` or `SUPPRESS`.
- Default state is `SUPPRESS`; ambiguity is first-class and always suppressive.
- No content storage or individual attribution is permitted.
- Latency is corroborative only and never triggers surfacing on its own.
- No tunable thresholds or admin overrides are allowed; constants are compiled into code.

Suppression reason codes (one-hot, immutable):
- `INSUFFICIENT_TIME`
- `INSUFFICIENT_VOLUME`
- `NO_CONVERGENCE`
- `BASELINE_UNSTABLE`
- `HIGH_AMBIGUITY`
